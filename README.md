# Referral codes

![alt tag](https://github.com/karina001/referralcodes/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-16%20at%2010.42.18%20PM.png)

## How it's made:
This is a fullstack app leveraging node JS, express and mongo. The app serves as a crowdsourcing site for referral promotions. A referral promotion is a dual-sided deal that is typically given to a customer in order to improve customer loyalty. The idea is that if the customer shares a promotion deal with her friend for a particular product or service, and her friend redeems that deal, the customer is rewarded. This duality aspect of referral promotions make them a popular strategy to gain more customers. Nevertheless, many people don't share their referral promotions. This allows users to post their referrals to an extensive community with one click. 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node JS, express mongo DB
This was a simple CRUD based application with express and mongo db.

## Optimizations
When I have more time I plan on going back to add further styling.

## Lessons Learned:
In this project, I learned a lot about server-side programming and the different frameworks for building web applications on top of node JS. I learned that express for example, is very helpful for simplifying the server creation process. I also learned more deeply about the different CRUD operations.
