## How it's made:
The idea behind this app is to allow a user to post a fan message onto a 21Savage fan site. Each message can upvoted, downvoted or removed. In completing this project I learned a lot about how templates get rendered to web pages. In terms of the MVC framework, as the controller goes into the "model" to get data
the controller will pass this data back to the template, which will render what we see. Essentially, the MVC a process for interacting with apps.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node JS, mongo DB
More than anything, node JS as this particular app was back-end heavy. 

## Optimizations
When I have more time, I plan on improving the styling and perhpas modify the fan page so that it supports a new artist every month and people can posts their comments to be delivered to that artist.

## Lessons Learned:
In completing this project I learned a lot about the underlying HTTP requests that enable users to complete CRUD tasks in order to request and serve information. I also learned a lot about the model view controller framework.
